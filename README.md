   PKGui is the graphic wallet for the pennykoin currency project.  It is mainly based on the conceal wallet from circle foundation, but contains codes from numerous sources as well as custom.


   Binaries are provided for linux & windows, hopefully a mac build coming soon.  Build directions will be posted in this space.
