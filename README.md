  Pennykoin is a private, secure cryptocurrency primarily forked form digital/dark/ducknote. There was no premine or ICO, all coins are emitted as mining rewards or interest. Pennykoin works like cash, nobody can track your purchases, or see what's in your wallet. But it's easier than cash, it works like an online checking account, including an option to deposit pennykoin and earn interest.
  
  
  PKGui is the graphic wallet for the pennykoin currency project.  It is mainly ported from the conceal wallet from circle foundation, but contains codes from numerous sources as well as custom.  


   Binaries are provided for linux & windows, hopefully a mac build coming soon.  Build directions will be posted in this space.
